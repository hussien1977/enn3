Cevahir Mall is located in Istanbul, Turkey and it is one of the largest shopping malls

There isn't a bank, but
there are plenty of cash machines, and all the
shops accept cashless payments.
There aren't

For more details, contact the information office

I bought a LoudHouse speaker and I'm really pleased with it.
It came with a free USB
cable, and the battery was fully/completely charged after just three hours.
It was
easy/quick to connect it to my phone. Although it's portable/light, the sound is really
excellent/goodd.
It has a great / long battery life, which lasts for 20 hours.
I got the
pink one, and it's really attractive/pretty. Overall, I highly recommend this speaker.

He was forever

Pierre.
Ibrahim learnt to speak some French with
him. He also learnt about France.

to talk about what they wanted to do when they
left school.
One day, Ibrahim said 'I think I'll be
a zoologist. Then I can study animals in different
countries.'
5 When Ibrahim left school, he studied zoology
at Cairo University. Now he is a well-known
zoologist.
He works in France and he is writing a
book about animals in Africa.

Too few leopards!
There used to be many Persian Leopards
living in Iraq.
However, in 2022, there
were only about 25 leopards left in the
country.
Today, conservationists are increasing
efforts to protect the remaining leopards.
The loss of habitat, hunting and war has
caused a big decrease in leopard numbers.
The leopards are endangered, and it is
against the law to hunt them. People do
not hunt the leopards, but they do hunt wild goats for food.
Unfortunately,
this is removing the natural food of the leopards.
Two Iraqi brothers, Nabaz and Bahaz Faruq Ali, want to save the leopards.
They believe that the leopards are an important part of Iraqi culture and
identity.
They are determined to save the leopards, and they have successfully
taken photos of the leopards in the Bamo mountain area.
Bamo mountain is
remote, so the brothers believe it is the perfect place for the leopards to breed
and increase their numbers.
Answer the questions.
a Why was there a big decrease in numbers?
b Why do the brothers want to save the leopards?
c Why can't people hunt leopards?
d Why is Bamo Mountain the perfect place for leopards?

Read about Ali's career before doing Exercises 8 and 9.
Ali really enjoyed primary school. He learnt a lot of things and he read and he read a lot of books at home.
However, when he went to secondary school, things changed. He had to stay at home for his mother who was ill, so he
stopped working hard. He didn't like homework like he used to.
At school, the first year was easy. In the second year he found the work difficult and got very worried. The pages were
worried. They wanted him to go to university so that he could get a good job.
School is boring,' said Ali. 'I would rather leave school and get a job. That's what my friends are going to do.'
At the end of the second year, the family went on holiday. His father and Ali loved farming. Ali liked to help with the
animals. One day, he said, 'I want to be a farmer.
I want to learn about farming with my own cows.' He also said to his father he wanted to be an entrepreneur.
His parents were very pleased. You can come to the farm every summer if you work hard,' they said. Ali enjoyed his
family and was no longer bored. He couldn't stop thinking about all the work he would have to do to make up for the bad
year.
Ali worked very hard. In the final year, he was one of the best in his class. He knows what he wants to do now, and it's
much easier for him to work hard.
